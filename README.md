# design_pattern_impl

a collection af design pattrens implementation in python.

## 1. Singleton

implementing singleton pattern in python. the singleton pattern is a creational pattern that ensures that only one object of a particular class is ever created. all further references to objects of the singleton class refer to the same underlying instance.
> the first two implementations are the best practice for implementing singleton pattern in python. the third implementation is not recommended.

## 2. Factory

implementing factory pattern in python. the factory pattern is a creational pattern that uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created. this is done by creating objects by calling a factory method—either specified in an interface and implemented by child classes, or implemented in a base class and optionally overridden by derived classes—rather than by calling a constructor.
